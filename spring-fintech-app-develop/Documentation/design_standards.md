## Design System

### Googleâ€™s Material Design
- We decided to use Google's Material Design as our primary design system, since it provides a cohesive and adaptable foundation for building user interfaces that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing.
- To implement Material Design principles effectively, we are leveraging Material-UI (now known as MUI) as our component library. MUI is a popular React UI framework that provides a comprehensive suite of pre-built, customizable components that follow Material Design guidelines.
