# Development Standards Documentation

## Introduction

This document outlines the development standards and coding conventions for our project. It ensures consistency and quality across the codebase.

### Checkstyle

Our project will be using the Maven plugin Checkstyle. Checkstyle is a development tool that helps programmers adhere to a coding standard by checking Java source code for compliance with configurable rules. It automates the process of code review, ensuring coding standards are consistently enforced throughout the project.

## Coding Conventions

### Line Length

- **Maximum Line Length**: Limit lines to a maximum of 120 characters. Enforced by `LineLength`.

### Naming Conventions

- **Class and Type Names**: Follow CamelCase. Enforced by Checkstyle's `TypeName`.

### Javadoc

- Ensure methods have proper Javadoc comments. Enforced by `JavadocMethod`.

### Whitespace and Formatting

- Ensure proper whitespace around operators and keywords. Managed by `WhitespaceAround`.

### Complexity

- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Limit to a maximum of 10. Managed by `CyclomaticComplexity`.

### Method Length

- Limit methods to a maximum of 100 lines. Managed by `MethodLength`.

### Imports

- Avoid star imports to keep the code clean. Managed by `AvoidStarImport`.

### Modifier Order

- Ensure modifiers are in the correct order. Enforced by `ModifierOrder`.
- Refer to [Modifier Order Documentation](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/checks/modifier/modifierorder.html) for correct order.

## Integration in CI/CD Pipeline

The Checkstyle plugin is integrated into our Maven build pipeline to automatically enforce these standards. Reports are generated for each build, highlighting areas of non-compliance.

## Compliance and Reporting

The results from Checkstyle checks are reviewed regularly to ensure adherence to the coding standards. Developers are encouraged to fix issues promptly.

## Continuous Improvement

We regularly review and update our Checkstyle rules to adapt to evolving best practices in software design and development.
